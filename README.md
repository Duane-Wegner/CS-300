CS-300 Analysis and Design

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

  In this project, I developed a course planner application that allows users to load, view, and look up course details like prerequisites and course titles. The main problem was figuring out how to organize and display course information clearly so users could quickly find what they needed. I needed to make sure the program was easy to use and could handle different ways people might interact with it, especially when searching for specific courses.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

  To solve the problem, I thought carefully about how to store and access the course information so it would be fast and easy to retrieve specific course details. I chose a structure that made it simple to look up courses based on their course numbers, which helped make the program run smoothly. Knowing about data organization was important because it allowed me to make smart choices to keep the application efficient and responsive.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

  One of the challenges I faced was making sure the program would work whether users typed in course names in uppercase, lowercase, or mixed case. Initially, users had to enter course names exactly as they appeared in the data, which could be frustrating. I solved this by adjusting the program to ignore case differences, making it much easier for users. Testing out different situations and fixing small issues also helped me improve the program’s usability.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

  This project taught me the value of planning out smaller parts of a program separately, making it easier to understand and adjust each piece. By breaking down the tasks, like loading data, listing courses, and displaying course details, I was able to stay organized and flexible. This approach helped me realize that designing each part carefully makes the whole program stronger and easier to improve in the future.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

  This project has helped me focus on writing code that’s clear, easy to follow, and simple to update. I used descriptive names for different parts of the code and added comments to explain what each part does. This not only makes the code easier for others to understand but also helps me if I need to make changes later. I learned that writing organized code now can save a lot of time in the future, making the program easier to troubleshoot and adapt as needed.
